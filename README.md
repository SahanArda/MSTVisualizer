# Minimum Spanning Tree Visualiser

This Java project implements and visualises a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's Algorithm. The program allows users to input the number of vertices, edges, and weights of a graph, and then it generates both the original graph that the user inputted and its MST.

## Features

- **User Input**: User is prompted to enter the vertices, edges, and weights to dynamically create a graph.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: The minimum spanning tree (MST) is found using this algorithm from the original graph.
- **Graph Visualisation**: Displays the original graph and MST side by side.
- **Interactive Console**: Ensures proper input validation for vertices, edges, and weights.

## Technology Stack

## Program Overview

In this program, users are prompted via the console to input details about their graph (number of vertices, edges, and weights). The program then generates a visual representation of the graph on the left, and its **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is displayed on the right. The MST is calculated using **Kruskal's Algorithm**, which finds the set of edges that connect all vertices with the least total weight.

Hereâ€™s an example of the visualized graphs (original on the left and MST on the right):
